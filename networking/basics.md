# Networking Basics

## OSI Model (7 Layers)
1. Physical  
2. Data Link  
3. Network  
4. Transport  
5. Session  
6. Presentation  
7. Application  

## Common Protocols
- TCP – reliable
- UDP – fast, not reliable
- HTTP/HTTPS – web traffic
- DNS – domain lookups

## Commands
- `ping <ip>`
- `traceroute <ip>`
- `netstat`
- `ip a` or `ifconfig`

Notes will be updated as I learn more.
